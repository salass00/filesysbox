filesysbox.library 53.1 (16.7.2015)

- First released version.


filesysbox.library 53.2 (6.8.2015)

- FBXQMM_MOUNT_CONTROL doesn't skip the first character of the Control string
  on AROS any more.


filesysbox.library 53.3 (13.8.2015)

- CHECKWRITABLE() now also checks if the FBXVF_READ_ONLY flag is set.

- Removed code for opening and closing of intuition.library since this library
  was not used anywhere.


filesysbox.library 53.4 (23.8.2015)

- Moved the opening and closing of dos.library and utility.library to the
  libInit() and libExpunge() functions.

- Fixed error reporting in FbxWriteFile().

- Rewrote and simplified comment handling in FbxExamineAll().

- FbxExamineAll() now also stops scanning on any error encountered.


filesysbox.library 53.5 (26.8.2015)

- FbxExamineAll() now only returns DOSTRUE when there are more entries
  available.

- Fixed a bad pointer access in FbxExamineAllEnd() introduced by a change in
  the last version.


filesysbox.library 53.6 (26.12.2015)

- FbxSameLock() now returns DOSTRUE if entry pointers are the same.

- Removed the now useless path comparison in FbxSameLock().


filesysbox.library 53.7 (26.4.2018)

- Got rid of all the GetXxxBase macros.

- Fixed an out of bounds array access in FbxUpdatePaths() which would result
  in memory after the FbxFS struct being trashed.


filesysbox.library 54.0 (22.12.2022)

- Added timezone conversion code using locale.library.

- Calculate a path hash for fib_DiskKey unless FBXF_USE_INO flag is set.

- Added FBXF_USE_FILL_DIR_STAT flag to avoid unnecessary getattr() calls for
  filesystems like ssh2-handler that already provide all the stat data in
  readdir(). 

- Don't treat ENOSYS return value from FbxSetAmigaProtectionFlags() as an
  error.

- Rewrote the FbxFillInfoData() function and made it set id_BytesPerBlock to
  512 instead of zero if a volume is not available.

- Modified path handling for Ext2FileSystem which only accepts "/" as path
  argument for the file system root directory and not "".

- Rewrote FbxReturnMountMsg() using ReplyPkt() and added a NULL msg safety
  check.

- Added some more validity checks when reading FSSM from device node in
  FbxSetupFS().

- Added validity checks in code for getting FSSM in FbxQueryMountMsg().

- Changed CHECKVOLUME() macro to return ERROR_NOT_A_DOS_DISK instead of
  ERROR_OBJECT_IN_USE when the filesystem is inhibited.

- Added semaphore protection in FbxHandleTimerEvent().

- Added the FbxQueryFS() and FbxQueryFSTags() functions.

- Added the FbxGetSysTime() function.


filesysbox.library 54.1 (14.1.2023)

- A rename operation with exactly the same source and destination is now
  treated as a no-op and returns success rather than ERROR_OBJECT_EXISTS.

- Rename operations where the the only change is in letter casing (e.g.
  "rename tmp TMP") no longer fail with ERROR_OBJECT_EXISTS on case
  insensitive file system implementations.

- Advance the file position in FSWrite() also if write() returns a lower
  number of bytes written than was specified.

- Implemented the same charset conversion system that is used in the latest
  AmigaOS 4 filesysbox versions. Internally filesysbox still uses UTF-8 for
  all strings and conversion only happens when strings are passed to or from
  the AmigaDOS API. In order for the conversion to be reversible any UTF-8
  characters that do not have an equivalent in the local charset will be
  converted into URL-style escape sequences where the character is specified
  as a base32 encoded character sequence preceded by a percent symbol.


filesysbox.library 54.2 (16.1.2023)

- Fixed support for codesets other than ISO-8859-1/latin-1 (was not working
  before due to size and attributes parameters being switched around in the
  AllocMem() call).

- Now ignores the ".language" extension when looking for a codeset based on
  loc_LanguageName.

- UTF-8 to local charset conversion now uses an AVL tree instead of iterating
  over the maptable array to find a match.

- Added experimental ACTION_DIE packet support.


filesysbox.library 54.3 (18.1.2023)

- AllocFuseFileInfo() did not clear the allocated fuse_file_info structure
  which resulted in randomly occurring bugs like otherwise legal ACTION_SEEK
  packets failing with ERROR_ACTION_NOT_KNOWN if the nonseekable flag happened
  to be set. This has now been fixed by explicitly clearing the memory before
  it is used.

- Changed to use ULONGs for the uptime timestamps used in FbxEventLoop() to
  save some CPU cycles.

- Rewrote the FbxExamineAll() function to not make assumptions about the sizes
  of the various ExAllData fields.


filesysbox.library 54.4 (23.6.2023)

- When setting fib_Size/ed_Size clamp file size to (INT32_MAX-1) if the field
  is 32-bit (LONG/ULONG).

- Fixed a memory leak in the ExNext directory scanning implementation (nodes
  are removed from the dirdatalist but not freed) that was already there in
  the 0.730 version of the library.

- Implemented a lock handler process to allow file systems to be unmounted
  even if there are outstanding locks/notifications.

- AmigaOS 3 versions are now compiled with -mregparm enabling the use of
  registers d0/d1 and a0/a1 for parameter passing in internal function
  calls.

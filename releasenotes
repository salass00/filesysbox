filesysbox.library 53.1 (16.7.2015)

- First released version.


filesysbox.library 53.2 (6.8.2015)

- FBXQMM_MOUNT_CONTROL doesn't skip the first character of the Control string
  on AROS any more.


filesysbox.library 53.3 (13.8.2015)

- CHECKWRITABLE() now also checks if the FBXVF_READ_ONLY flag is set.

- Removed code for opening and closing of intuition.library since this library
  was not used anywhere.


filesysbox.library 53.4 (23.8.2015)

- Moved the opening and closing of dos.library and utility.library to the
  libInit() and libExpunge() functions.

- Fixed error reporting in FbxWriteFile().

- Rewrote and simplified comment handling in FbxExamineAll().

- FbxExamineAll() now also stops scanning on any error encountered.


filesysbox.library 53.5 (26.8.2015)

- FbxExamineAll() now only returns DOSTRUE when there are more entries
  available.

- Fixed a bad pointer access in FbxExamineAllEnd() introduced by a change in
  the last version.


filesysbox.library 53.6 (26.12.2015)

- FbxSameLock() now returns DOSTRUE if entry pointers are the same.

- Removed the now useless path comparison in FbxSameLock().


filesysbox.library 53.7 (26.4.2018)

- Got rid of all the GetXxxBase macros.

- Fixed an out of bounds array access in FbxUpdatePaths() which would result
  in memory after the FbxFS struct being trashed.


filesysbox.library 54.0 (22.12.2022)

- Added timezone conversion code using locale.library.

- Calculate a path hash for fib_DiskKey unless FBXF_USE_INO flag is set.

- Added FBXF_USE_FILL_DIR_STAT flag to avoid unnecessary getattr() calls for
  filesystems like ssh2-handler that already provide all the stat data in
  readdir(). 

- Don't treat ENOSYS return value from FbxSetAmigaProtectionFlags() as an
  error.

- Rewrote the FbxFillInfoData() function and made it set id_BytesPerBlock to
  512 instead of zero if a volume is not available.

- Modified path handling for Ext2FileSystem which only accepts "/" as path
  argument for the file system root directory and not "".

- Rewrote FbxReturnMountMsg() using ReplyPkt() and added a NULL msg safety
  check.

- Added some more validity checks when reading FSSM from device node in
  FbxSetupFS().

- Added validity checks in code for getting FSSM in FbxQueryMountMsg().

- Changed CHECKVOLUME() macro to return ERROR_NOT_A_DOS_DISK instead of
  ERROR_OBJECT_IN_USE when the filesystem is inhibited.

- Added semaphore protection in FbxHandleTimerEvent().

- Added the FbxQueryFS() and FbxQueryFSTags() functions.

- Added the FbxGetSysTime() function.


filesysbox.library 54.1 (14.1.2023)

- A rename operation with exactly the same source and destination is now
  treated as a no-op and returns success rather than ERROR_OBJECT_EXISTS.

- Rename operations where the the only change is in letter casing (e.g.
  "rename tmp TMP") no longer fail with ERROR_OBJECT_EXISTS on case
  insensitive file system implementations.

- Advance the file position in FSWrite() also if write() returns a lower
  number of bytes written than was specified.

- Implemented the same charset conversion system that is used in the latest
  AmigaOS 4 filesysbox versions. Internally filesysbox still uses UTF-8 for
  all strings and conversion only happens when strings are passed to or from
  the AmigaDOS API. In order for the conversion to be reversible any UTF-8
  characters that do not have an equivalent in the local charset will be
  converted into URL-style escape sequences where the character is specified
  as a base32 encoded character sequence preceded by a percent symbol.


filesysbox.library 54.2 (16.1.2023)

- Fixed support for codesets other than ISO-8859-1/latin-1 (was not working
  before due to size and attributes parameters being switched around in the
  AllocMem() call).

- Now ignores the ".language" extension when looking for a codeset based on
  loc_LanguageName.

- UTF-8 to local charset conversion now uses an AVL tree instead of iterating
  over the maptable array to find a match.

- Added experimental ACTION_DIE packet support.


filesysbox.library 54.3 (18.1.2023)

- AllocFuseFileInfo() did not clear the allocated fuse_file_info structure
  which resulted in randomly occurring bugs like otherwise legal ACTION_SEEK
  packets failing with ERROR_ACTION_NOT_KNOWN if the nonseekable flag happened
  to be set. This has now been fixed by explicitly clearing the memory before
  it is used.

- Changed to use ULONGs for the uptime timestamps used in FbxEventLoop() to
  save some CPU cycles.

- Rewrote the FbxExamineAll() function to not make assumptions about the sizes
  of the various ExAllData fields.


filesysbox.library 54.4 (23.6.2023)

- When setting fib_Size/ed_Size clamp file size to (INT32_MAX-1) if the field
  is 32-bit (LONG/ULONG).

- Fixed a memory leak in the ExNext directory scanning implementation (nodes
  are removed from the dirdatalist but not freed) that was already there in
  the 0.730 version of the library.

- Implemented a lock handler process to allow file systems to be unmounted
  even if there are outstanding locks/notifications.

- AmigaOS 3 versions are now compiled with -mregparm enabling the use of
  registers d0/d1 and a0/a1 for parameter passing in internal function
  calls.


filesysbox.library 54.5 (21.7.2023)

- Added the FbxGetUpTime() function to the jumptable.

- Made FbxLockName2Path() return FALSE for any paths containing "." or ".." as
  a file or directory name.

- AmigaOS 3: Added a version compiled for the 68060 CPU.


filesysbox.library 54.6 (3.6.2025)

- AmigaOS 3: Added support for ACTION_CHANGE_FILE_POSITION64,
  ACTION_CHANGE_FILE_SIZE64, ACTION_GET_FILE_POSITION64 and
  ACTION_GET_FILE_SIZE64 packets.

- ACTION_SEEK and ACTION_SET_FILE_SIZE now fail with ERROR_OBJECT_TOO_LARGE if
  the return value is too large to fit into dp_Res1.


filesysbox.library 54.7 (10.6.2025)

- Fixed an infinite recursion bug in the new V54.6 ACTION_SET_FILE_SIZE
  implementation caused by the FbxSetFileSize() function calling itself
  instead of FbxSetFileSize64() as it was supposed to.


filesysbox.library 54.8 (2.2.2026)

- FbxCollectLock() now overwrites fl_Volume with a BPTR to the lockhandler's
  own volume structure instead of leaving it pointing to freed memory.

- Added the new FbxDismount command for cleanly unmounting FUSE file systems.


filesysbox.library 54.9 (18.2.2026)

- Use timer.device GetUpTime() function on AROS.

- Fixed invalid assumptions in FbxIsParent() and FbxUpdatePaths() that the
  number of characters is the same as the number of bytes and that lower and
  upper case letters are always encoded as the same size.

- FbxParentDir() now calls a new FbxInternalLocateObject() function to avoid
  the already UTF-8 encoded path erroneously being interpreted as being in the
  local charset.


filesysbox.library 54.10 (d.m.2026)

- Removed all support for non-UTF8 file systems (FBXF_ENABLE_UTF8_NAMES flag
  not set) as nothing was using it and it was just needlessly complicating
  things.

- Added back support for the ACTION_GET_DISK_FSSM and ACTION_FREE_DISK_FSSM
  packets as in the original version 0.730 filesysbox.library.

- Don't mask with ENTRYHASHMASK when generating a hash for st_ino/fib_DiskKey.

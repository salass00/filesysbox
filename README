Filesysbox.library is a FUSE compatible file system layer originally developed
by Leif Salomonsson. It manages locks, notifications, file handles, packets,
update timeouts and more, freeing the file system of these jobs. Version 0.730
of the library was released as open source and was used as a basis for this
version.

The included FbxDismount command can be used to cleanly unmount FUSE file
systems even if there are outstanding locks/notify requests. Any outstanding
locks and notify requests will be passed to and handled by the filesysbox
lockhandler process.

NOTE: This is not the same as "Assign DISMOUNT" that only removes the visible
device/volume node but leaves the actual handler/file system running in the
background.
